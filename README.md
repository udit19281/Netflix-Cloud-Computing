TODO:

Elasticity:

Since both the servers provide specialised tasks.System will always cater to special requests
of the client in an optimal manner.

Scalability:
With servers performing specialized tasks, both the servers will never be overwhelmed
with requests. Hence the system can handle a large number of requests and adapt to a
growing user base.
Secondly, for a lot of clients, the master worker is equipped with concurrent handling of clients.
React can handle multiple clients.

Availability:
Databases of both the servers store the same data at all times .If one of them fails, the
system will exclusively use the second one. Databases are write synchronised
